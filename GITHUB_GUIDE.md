## Step-by-Step GitHub Guide

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a professional username (like: johndoe-dev, jane-smith-eng, etc.)

### STEP 2: Create New Repository
1. Log into GitHub
2. Click the **green "New"** button (or go to https://github.com/new)
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Repository name**: `flight-dynamics-simulation`
   - **Description**: `6-DOF aircraft flight dynamics simulation with Python`
   - **Visibility**: ‚úÖ **Public** (so employers can see it)
   - **Initialize**: ‚ùå Do NOT check "Add README" (we have one)
   - **Add .gitignore**: ‚ùå Do NOT check (we made our own)
   - **Choose a license**: ‚ùå Skip for now
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### STEP 3: Get Your Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. 
**Copy the HTTPS URL** - it looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flight-dynamics-simulation.git
```

### STEP 4: Upload Your Code
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run these commands **ONE BY ONE**:

```powershell
# Initialize git in your project
git init

# Add all your files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Professional flight dynamics simulation"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Connect to GitHub (REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flight-dynamics-simulation.git

# Upload to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

## üéØ Interview Talking Points

**"I built a professional flight dynamics simulator that models 6-degree-of-freedom aircraft motion using Python. It includes real aerodynamic forces, numerical integration of differential equations, and interactive visualization. The simulation can predict aircraft behavior over time and export data for analysis."**

**Key Features to Mention:**
- Solves 12 coupled differential equations in real-time
- Handles gimbal lock and numerical stability issues
- Provides data export for further analysis
- Uses industry-standard libraries (SciPy, NumPy)

## üéâ After Upload

1. **Check your repo**: Go to your GitHub URL and verify all files are there
2. **Add to resume**: Include the GitHub link on your resume
3. **Share with confidence**: This demonstrates real engineering skills!

Your project URL will be:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flight-dynamics-simulation`

**This is professional-quality work that will impress employers!** üõ©Ô∏è
